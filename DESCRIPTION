Description: 
    Takes an R expression and returns a Job object with a $stop() method
    which can be called to terminate the background job. Also provides timeouts
    and other mechanisms for automatically terminating a background job. The
    result of the expression is available synchronously via $result or
    asynchronously with callbacks or through the 'promises' package framework.
